# Analysis-and-Visualization-of-Indian-Unicorns
Overview: This project focuses on visualizing and analyzing the dataset of Indian unicorns. Using Google Colab, we perform data preprocessing and generate various visualizations to uncover insights about these high-growth startups.

Libraries Used Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis NumPy: For numerical operations Plotly: For interactive visualizations Seaborn: For statistical data visualization Matplotlib: For static plots

Dataset This dataset includes information about Indian unicorns such as valuation, financial performance, and founding details.

Steps & Visualizations Import Libraries: Essential libraries for data preprocessing and visualization are imported.

Data Preprocessing: Data is loaded and inspected. Unnecessary columns are dropped. Null values are handled. Data types and summary statistics are examined.

Data Visualization: Box Plot: Detects outliers in the dataset. Count Plot: Visualizes the distribution of total funding. Histogram: Shows the distribution of different attributes. Joint Plot: Analyzes the relationship between different variables. Pair Plot: Explores multivariate relationships in the dataset.
